# MUSICBANDPROJECT
This is an HTML project where I embedded sounds to seperate images, in this case it was a drumset. You can click on the different parts of the drumset to make their respective sound. The idea is that you should be able to play the drums along with the song attached tp the website. This project taught me how to embed different sounds to seperate images, and how to interact with them.
